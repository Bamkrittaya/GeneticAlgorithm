# GeneticAlgorithm

This repository demonstrates the **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** — a population-based optimization technique inspired by natural evolution. Genetic Algorithms evolve candidate solutions over generations using **selection**, **crossover**, and **mutation** to search for good solutions in complex problem spaces.

This project is designed for **learning and experimentation**, showing how GA works in practice through simple examples and classic problems.

## 📌 Project Overview

Genetic Algorithms are widely used for optimization problems where the search space is large, noisy, or lacks a clear analytical solution.

This repository includes:

- **Simple_demo**  
  A minimal implementation of a genetic algorithm focusing on core GA concepts.

- **8_Queens**  
  A GA solution to the classic *8-Queens problem*, where the goal is to place eight queens on a chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.

- **Hyperparameter_tunning**  
  Experiments exploring how GA hyperparameters (population size, mutation rate, crossover rate, generations) affect convergence and performance.

- **Diagrams & Reports**  
  Supporting materials such as diagrams, slides, and written reports explaining GA workflow and experimental results.
